# Neural Network From Scratch (C#)
This repo contains the files i used to make a little neural network from scratch.
The program file contains an already setup network, made to fit the given image.

here is some cool gifs of the process
(the program also generates these when its done!)

To run your own, just build the project with the latest version of [SFML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SFML.Net), then add an image labeled "train_target.png" (must be a png)

I recommend 3blue1brown's series [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) for anyone wanting to learn about the pain thats going on inside.

[Sebastian leauges video on the topic](https://youtu.be/hfMk-kjRv4c) also helped for insight on how to actually apply the gradients, everything else was done with minimal tutorial following as i enjoy figuring out the (usually self made) problems
